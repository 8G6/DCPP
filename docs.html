                <h2>1) Data Collection</h2>
                For data Collection we used the historical data of Dogie Coin from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/historical-data/">here</a> 
                <br>
                The data included <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Highest value in $ obtained for Dogie Coin at a given date</li>
                    <li>Lowest value in $ obtained for Dogie Coin at a given date</li>
                    <li>Opening value in $ obtained for Dogie Coin at a given date</li>
                    <li>Closing value in $ obtained for Dogie Coin at a given date</li>
                </ol>
                With the help of JavaScript we collected the data from 2013 Dec 15 to 2022 Feb 23 and stored it dateset.json

                With the help of chart.js we plotted High , Low , Opening and Closing values agaist dates.
                From the plots we reached the following concultion

                <ol>
                    <li>As we know for any crypto currencies initial values will be constant for a long time.
                        <br>This trend can be obsvered in Dogie coin data too, From 2013 Dec 15 to Dec 19 2020 the values were almost constent.(1)</li>
                    <li>From Feb 1 2021 to Dec 17 2021 The data shows series irregularities that include a all time high values (2)</li>
                    <li>From Dec 17 2021 to Feb 23 2022 The data is consistant  (3)</li>

                <h2>3) Filtering Useful Data</h2>
                From the Data Visualization we got an optimal dataset that is data from  Dec 17 2021 to Feb 23 2022

                <h2>4) Selecting Optimal Algoritham</h2>
                Since the values are in numbers we can use regression, And for regression of these datasets we can use curve fitting as the plot matches a curve<br>
                <h3>Curve Fitting</h3>
                Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a "smooth" function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization,to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables.Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data,and is subject to a degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.

                 As seen from the animation we can see that if we get the optimal values of the curve coffients we will get a best approximation of the curve that could fit most of our data points
